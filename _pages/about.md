# About Me
{: style="text-align: justify" }
Currently, I am a senior B.Sc. student at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). My research interests include: **Computer Vision**, **3D Vision** and their applications in **robotics** and **Self-driving cars**. In May 2020, I joined **Prof. Pilehvar**'s NLP reading group to gain intuitions about research and academic papers. Between September and December 2020, I was working at **Dadmatech Corp.**, Where I developed a neural based solution to convert Persian informal text to formal text. Moreover, In February 2021, I started working on an NLP research project at **Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)** under the joint supervision of **Prof. Pilehvar** and **Prof. Eetemadi**.

Below is a brief version of my CV. <!-- Full version available [here](/files/CV.pdf). -->
