# About Me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am an incoming Computer Science Masters student at <b>Simon Fraser University</b>, starting Fall 2022. I got my Bachelors degree from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) in 2022. My primary research interests include <b>Computer Vision</b>, <b>3D Vision</b>, and their applications in <b>robotics</b> and <b>self-driving cars</b>. During my studies, I have enjoyed working with Prof. Vincent Lepetit, Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, and Prof. Sauleh Eetemadi on various projects.

* **Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG)**, Graz, Austria  
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 16px;margin-top: -20px;"><i>Research Intern Under the Supervision of Prof. Vincent Lepetit</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 13px;margin-top: -22px;">May 2021 - March 2022</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;margin-top: -18px;">
In May 2021, I joined <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home/">ICG, TU Graz</a> as a research intern, supervised by <a href="https://vincentlepetit.github.io">Prof. Vincent Lepetit</a>. 3D Vision, particularly scene understanding, has always been a hot research area as it has various applications in many areas such as Augmented Reality. In this project, we extend the previous method on scene understanding that adapted the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, originally designed to learn to play games of high-state complexity, and reconstruct general 3D room layouts from a color image and obtain accurate room layouts. We also show that our differentiable renderer can easily be extended for rendering 3D planar polygons and polygon embeddings. Our method shows high performance on the Matterport3D-Layout dataset, without introducing hard constraints on room layout configurations. The paper has been submitted to <b>TPAMI Special Section on the Best Papers of ICCV2021</b>. The pre-print is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03204">arXiv:2207.03204</a> and the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/vevenom/MonteScene">github</a>.

* **Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS)**, Tehran, Iran  
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 16px;margin-top: -20px;"><i>Research Assistant Under the Supervision of Prof. Eetemadi, Prof. Pilehvar</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 13px;margin-top: -22px;">February 2021 - June 2022</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;margin-top: -18px;">
In February 2021, I started working on a research project at TeIAS under the joint supervision of <a href="https://pilehvar.github.io">Prof. Pilehvar</a> and <a href="http://www.sauleh.ir">Prof. Eetemadi</a>. Contemporary state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, have a massive number of trainable parameters, resulting in lower inference time and large memory footprints. Recent research has proved model compression methods to be effective. This project aims to tackle this problem and design a compression algorithm that results in a model that jointly benefits parameter efficiency and low latency during inference time.

<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 16px;margin-top: -20px;"><i>Research Intern Under the Supervision of Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 13px;margin-top: -22px;">May 2020 - April 2021</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;margin-top: -18px;">
In May 2020, I joined Prof. Pilehvar's NLP <a href="https://teias.institute/natural-language-processing-nlp-reading-group">reading group</a>. The main objective of this group was to gain intuition about how to carry out research, mainly around NLP and Machine Learning (particularly Deep Learning). Our tasks included reading papers and writing summaries, and discussing ideas. We also initiated a <a href="https://nlpdataset.ir">website</a> that aims at listing datasets and tools for research and development in Farsi NLP.

* **Dadmatech**, Tehran, Iran  
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 16px;margin-top: -20px;"><i>Natural Language Processing Intern</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;font-size: 13px;margin-top: -22px;">September 2020 - December 2020</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;margin-top: -18px;">
Between September and December 2020, I was an intern at Dadmatech, A large start-up that develops AI-based text processing tools for Farsi text. Informal Farsi was formed, over a long time, when people started changing words and verbs while talking, and it gradually found its way to Farsi text as well. As a result, there are no rules to convert an informal Farsi text to a standard text. During my time at Dadmatech, I worked on developing a neural-based solution to convert informal Farsi text to normal text.
